	From farm to fork,information and communication technology sector is being enhanced to facilitate the farmers, 
croppers and related users of intelligent services.Technological revolution integrates the development of smart devices and IoT services. 
To feed the ever growing global population, the agriculture industry needs to be extended. 
Internet of Things opens the door wide for smart farming solution to increase the agricultural production. 
IoT technologies helps the farmers as a service by providing historical and real time data for predicting soil quality,
weather conditions and cropâ€™s health. Smart farming provides the enhanced facility for process automation and evaluation and waste reduction.
As a result, all these factors drastically increase the quality and quantity of the food products and decrease the production cost.
This paper outlines the promising solutions applied in the sphere of agriculture.
